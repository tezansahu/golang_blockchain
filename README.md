# Simple Blockchain using Golang

This repository contains the code for a simple Blockchain application, which also includes a wallets module 
and involves Bitcoin-like transactions to be made.

All code for this has been written using Golang and the data is stored locally using BadgerDB.

* The `blockchain` module contains code for implementing the functionality of the blockchain, the mining algorithm and the transactions.
* The `wallet` module implements the functionality of wallets locally.
* The `cli` module implements the Command Line Interface for the application


Use `go run main.go` (with necessary commands and flags) to run the application.
